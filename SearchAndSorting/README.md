# Search and Sorting Algorithms

## Binary Search CLI usage
Find a target element in a sorted array that has a defined lower boundary and upper boundary.
*Note that the sorted array will be built based on those last two input parameters:*
```
./bin/main SearchAndSort BinarySearch <targetElement> <lowerBounary> <upperBoundary>
```
